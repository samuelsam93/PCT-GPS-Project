100235 Bytes in GPSdata.log rn out of 2MB is ~5%
this is about 10 hours of data at full logging speed
which means we're at about 8.3 days of data storage available on QSPI at full speed
plus if we account for the full storage of the data logger, we are currently at 30% of data logger storage
3.3 x 10 hours gives us another 33 hours gets us to 9.68 days
This would get us dangerously close to overflowing, 
but we're at almost 10 days of storing data every 15 seconds
if we clock the gps to only start recording data for 2 minutes every 10 minutes,
that will multiply our storage time by about 5 getting us to 50 days which is a passable threshold
